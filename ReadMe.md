The MySql Database is filled with Supplier Information who supply computer hardware parts and the cost they charge for those parts. The queries retrieve specific information about suppliers, parts, and their costs.

The web application is made of HTML, PHP, and CSS. It is made up of 5 php files (named query1, query2, etc.) one file for each query. The styles.css file gives the web application a beautiful and user friendly look. The php files connect to the database in the database server to retrieve the information.

The user either selects the information he needs or inputs a given criteria in the text box. When the user finishes putting the information he needs, he can press the submit button. When the submit button is pressed, the data is retrieved from the database and is shown to the user. If there are no results for the input that the user specified, the query will return a “No results found” message.
